This folder contains 3 versions of the same x86 assembly, each formatted for a different assembler. Included are files supporting [MASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Macro_Assembler), [GAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Assembler), and [NASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netwide_Assembler).

This version opts to use the `puts` function from C to output to the console. It is possible to use a `syscall` on Linux to print to the console from x86, but that method isn't portable, and modern Windows doesn't have an equivalent solution (a `syscall`-like system is available in DOS mode, though). Because of this, a C toolchain is required to build these files. I have included script files for using MSVC on Windows, and GCC or Clang on other systems.

**Windows**: You need to install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (preferably the latest version). If you want to use the NASM assembly file, you need to also install [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). To build, open the Developer Command Prompt, navigate to the folder with with the assembly files, and run either `msvc-masm.bat` or `msvc-nasm.bat`. After building, you can run it with `OwO`.

**\*NIX**: (including Linux) You need to install either GCC or Clang. If you want to use the NASM assembly file, you need to also install [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). To build, navigate in the terminal to the directory with the assembly files, and run either `./gcc-gas.sh` or `./gcc-nasm.sh`. If you are using Clang, then run `CC=clang ./gcc-gas.sh` or `CC=clang ./gcc-nasm.sh`. After building, you can run it with `./OwO`.
